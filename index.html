              <h2>Graduate Teaching Assistant (August 2024 - May 2025 | August 2022 - May 2023)</h2><!-- Title -->
              <p>I was a Graduate Teaching Assistant (TA) in the <a href="https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa</a>. <br></p>

              <p>During Fall 2022, I supported instruction for ICS 332: Operating Systems and ICS 451: Data Networks. In Spring 2023, I continued as a TA for ICS 332 and contributed to ICS 355: Security and Trust I. In these courses, I was responsible for grading assignments, providing detailed feedback, addressing student questions, and supporting instructional activities in the theoretical and practical components of the curriculum. <br></p>

              <p>In my role, I assessed homework for over 50 undergraduate students and provided detailed feedback to clarify complex topics and reinforce core course concepts. I held office hours to answer student questions and improve their understanding of the course material. Student feedback shows a significant positive impact from my support, with 86% of respondents rating their experience with my teaching assistance as a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. This high level of satisfaction emphasizes the effectiveness of my instructional support and mentorship. <br></p>

              <p>Also, I conducted practical hands-on demonstrations using Wireshark and Vagrant, bridging theoretical and practical knowledge. These demonstrations increased student engagement and provided a real-world context for networking and systems concepts. My teaching assistantship spanned the following courses: ICS 451 (Data Networks - Fall 2022, Fall 2024, Spring 2025), ICS 332 (Operating Systems - Fall 2022, Spring 2023), and ICS 355 (Security and Trust I - Spring 2023).</p>

              <h2>Graduate Research Assistant (May 2023 - Aug 2024)</h2><!-- Title -->
              
              <p>I contributed to advancing environmental modeling for the Hawaiian Islands as part of two machine-learning research projects. <br></p>

              <p>In the first project, supported by the CHANGE-HI grants (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2149133&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF #OIA-2149133</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2238375&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF #2238375</a>, and <a href="https://cascprojects.org/#/project/4f8c650ae4b0546c0c397b48/667da0ded34e67892486505c" target="_blank">PI-CASC G21AC10381</a>), I worked on statistical downscaling for future rainfall prediction in Hawaii. My responsibilities included generating rainfall forecasting maps by extracting CMIP6 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and applying statistical downscaling techniques using Python to support improved water resource management. I implemented site-specific linear regression models, Gaussian Processes using GPyTorch, and deep neural networks to establish baseline and advanced prediction models. These efforts contributed to a peer-reviewed journal paper (submitted - addressing revisions), where I co-authored novel AI-based methodologies and prepared results using LaTeX. I also developed rainfall map visualizations to understand spatial rainfall trends across the Hawaiian Islands. <br></p>

              <p>The second project, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mitre/" target="_blank">MITRE</a>, focused on estimating net radiation over the islands at a 250-meter spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution. I predicted incoming long-wave radiation during nighttime hours using simple linear regression and more complex neural network models implemented in TensorFlow. I analyzed satellite imagery and contributed to a technical report documenting the methods and findings. <br></p>
              
              <p>In both projects, I collaborated with computer scientists, geographers, and industry partners to integrate domain expertise with technical modeling. I also presented research findings at technical workshops, which improved stakeholder engagement and broadened the projects' visibility within academic and applied research communities.</p>

              <p>From August 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a Lecturer on Contract in <a href="https://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk/" , target="_blank">Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya</a>. In this role, I was the Instructor In Charge (IIC) for several undergraduate courses, including Computer Communication Networks, Embedded Systems, and Network & Web Application Design. I led tutorial sessions, student discussion sessions, and labs, focusing on hands-on learning and the practical application of concepts using programming tools like OpenCV, Python, C, and Java. <br> </p>
              
              <p>In addition to my primary courses, I contributed to interdisciplinary teaching by covering modules in Image Processing (CO543) and Networking for Electrical Engineering (CO253), supporting the Electrical Engineering curriculum. I collaborated with senior lecturers to create assignments, exams, and lesson plans that enhanced student engagement and improved course delivery. My role balanced independent instruction and teamwork, ensuring students gained a practical understanding of computer and electrical engineering. </p>

              <p>From August 2020 to August 2021, I was a Temporary Instructor (Graduate Teaching Assistant) in the <a href="https://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk/" , target="_blank">Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya</a>. During this period, I supported several undergraduate courses, including Computer Architecture, Advanced Computer Communication Networks, Embedded Systems, and a first-year computing course. I served as the Instructor in Charge (IIC) for several courses, responsible for developing and grading assignments for classes of about 60 students each semester. My tasks included preparing quizzes, designing lab exercises, and conducting review sessions to reinforce key concepts. <br> </p>

              <p>I automated the grading of the Network and Web Application Design course with GitHub Classroom and unit tests through GitHub Actions, making grading more efficient and consistent. This change significantly reduced grading time and sped up the feedback process. I also led a team of four teaching assistants for the Embedded Systems course, ensuring fair assessments across all lab sections while utilizing tools and programming languages like Git, GitHub, Python, C, and Java to manage coursework and support student learning. The courses I contributed to include CO513: Advanced Computer Communication Networks, CO324: Network and Web Application Design, CO321: Embedded Systems, CO224: Computer Architecture, and CO323: Computer Communication Networks II.</p>

              <h2>Trainee Associate Software Engineer (February 2019 - July 2019)</h2><!-- Title -->

              <p>From February 2019 to July 2019, I worked as a Trainee Associate Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/zone24x7/" , target="_blank">Zone24x7 (Pvt) Ltd</a> in Sri Jayawardenepura as part of the Big Data and Data Science team. I contributed to two major projects involving artificial intelligence solutions for KOHL, a large U.S.-based retail chain. I collaborated with my supervisor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hansa-perera/" target="_blank">Hansa Perera</a>, on a log-based machine learning R&D project that aimed to predict critical events by analyzing millions of system log files. I performed detailed data analysis, implemented topic modeling to cluster log events, and extracted pattern sequences to feed into a neural network for forecasting future log events. <br> </p>

              <p>In a second project focused on video-based machine learning, we examined in-store video feeds to identify anomalies in customer behavior. I developed machine learning components for anomaly detection, specifically utilizing the One-Class SVM algorithm to pinpoint outliers in customer visit patterns. This effort improved the accuracy of our detections and provided valuable insights for operational decision-making. <br> </p>

              <p>I drove data science deliverables throughout both projects by working closely with project managers, software engineers, system architects, and QA testers. I participated in sprint meetings, presenting updates and model performance insights to the client and the CTO. These updates helped shape the client's AI adoption strategies and highlighted the value of applied machine learning. </p>
